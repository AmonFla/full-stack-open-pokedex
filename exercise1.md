Language Chosen :PHP

Linting:

A good practice for developing is to have some rules of how to write, so it will be easy to read at another time or by another person. In the case of php we have a lot of IDES that have some linter rules that can be configured so check while you write. On the other hand, you have some tools like PHP Mess Detector, Code Sniffer and PHP LInt that can be used.

Testing:

For unit tests we have PHPUnit for unit testing, and for integration there are a lot of tools that can be used. If you are using a framework like Symfony for example it has some built in components for unit, functional and integration tests, so you have it all in the framework, but you can use external tools too, like selenium for example where you can write test with java, rubi, etc, or you can save the process and execute it again, in background.

Building:

In the case of PHP we do not have a build tool, but you can obfuscate the code, create phar files. For deploying you just have to upload the file to a web server and that's all.
